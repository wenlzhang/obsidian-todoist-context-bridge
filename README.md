## The Story Behind This Plugin

[Obsidian Todoist Context Bridge](https://exp.ptkm.net/obsidian-todoist-context-bridge) was crafted with five [PTKM Core Principles](https://exp.ptkm.net/ptkm-core-principles) that shape its functionality:

- **Task-Centered Workflow**: Prioritizing efficient task management and natural workflow integration
- **Context Preservation**: Ensuring no valuable information is lost in the task management process
- **Linking Everything**: Bridging the gap between Obsidian and Todoist
- **Focus on Priority**: Helping users concentrate on what truly matters
- **Reliable Redundancy**: Maintaining data integrity through smart synchronization

This plugin was born from a real-world challenge: the need to effectively highlight and track important tasks while preserving their complete context. As both an Obsidian enthusiast and Todoist power user, I discovered that while not every note-taking task warranted a place in my task manager, the crucial ones deserved focused attention and reliable tracking.

### The Challenge

Modern knowledge workers face a common dilemma: Obsidian excels at capturing tasks with rich context - embedding them within notes, projects, and thought processes. However, these important tasks can easily become buried in an ocean of notes and ideas. Todoist shines at task tracking and highlighting, but traditionally lacks the deep context that birthed these tasks.

### The Bridge

This plugin elegantly solves this challenge through four key mechanisms:

1. **Selective Sync**: Thoughtfully choose which tasks deserve promotion to your Todoist workflow
2. **Contextual Links**: Maintain robust bidirectional connections to your original Obsidian notes
3. **Reliable Redundancy**: Ensure task security through strategic presence in both systems
4. **Focused Management**: Keep your task system lean and relevant by promoting only what matters

## Support & Community

   - Maintains proper indentation and list structure
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     - [ ] Main task
         - [üìé View in Todoist](...)
         - Sub-task details from Todoist
         - Additional notes
         - List items preserved
     ```
2. **Sync full description from Todoist task**
   - Includes complete task context
   - Preserves metadata and reference links
   - Maintains original task location references
   - Useful for complete context review
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     - [ ] Main task
         - [üìé View in Todoist](...)
         - Original task in Obsidian: obsidian://...
            - Reference: obsidian://...
         - Sub-task details from Todoist
         - Additional notes
         - List items preserved
     ```

### Maintaining Temporal Context

The plugin provides comprehensive timestamp tracking to maintain temporal context:

1. **PTKM Alignment**:

### Auto-Tagging for Task Tracking

This plugin provides a feature that automatically tags the task in Obsidian when synced to Todoist.

- Automatically adds a customizable tag to tasks in Obsidian when synced to Todoist
    - No manual tagging needed before or after syncing
- Provides an extra layer of redundancy for tracking important tasks:
    - Tasks are tracked in Obsidian through tags
    - Tasks are managed in Todoist through the task list
    - Double verification ensures nothing falls through the cracks
- Aligns with PTKM principles:
    - **Reliable Redundancy**: Maintains task status in both systems
    - **Task-Centered Workflow**: Automates tracking without extra effort
    - **Focus on Priority**: Easily identify which important tasks are already in Todoist
- Customizable tag name to match your workflow
- Works seamlessly with text cleanup patterns (tags won't appear in Todoist)

**Usage Tips:**

- Place your cursor on a task line that is synced to Todoist
- Choose the appropriate sync command based on your needs
- Description content will be inserted with proper indentation
- Empty descriptions or metadata-only content will be handled gracefully
- Completed tasks cannot be synced to prevent conflicts

### Text Cleanup Patterns

The plugin provides powerful text cleanup capabilities to ensure your Todoist tasks remain clean and focused. These patterns are applied when syncing tasks from Obsidian to Todoist.

#### Default Cleanup Patterns

When enabled, the following patterns are automatically removed:

| Pattern Type | Example | Regex Pattern |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| Checkboxes | `- [ ] Task` | `^[\s-]*\[[ x?/-]\]` |
| Timestamps | `üìù 2024-11-23T22:09` | `üìù\s*\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}(?:T\d{2}:\d{2})?` |
| Block IDs | `^abc123` | `\^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$` |
| Tags | `#project` | `#[^\s]+` |
| Emojis | `üìÖ ‚úÖ` | Unicode emoji ranges |

#### Dataview Cleanup

Remove Dataview metadata fields from your tasks:

1. **Built-in Handling**:
   - Due date fields (e.g., `[due::2024-01-01]`)
   - Priority fields (e.g., `[p::1]`)
2. **Custom Fields**:
   - Add your own Dataview keys to remove
   - Example: If you use `[category::work]`, `[created::2024-01-01]` and `[c::#tag]`, add `category, created, c` to remove it
   - Multiple keys supported (comma-separated)

#### Moment.js Format Cleanup

Remove timestamps with optional prefixes using Moment.js format:

1. **Pattern Format**:
   - Uses Moment.js date format tokens
   - Optional text in square brackets
   - Multiple patterns supported (comma-separated)
2. **Common Examples**:
   - Basic timestamp: `YYYY-MM-DD` (matches `2024-01-01`)
   - With time: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm` (matches `2024-01-01T10:30`)
   - With prefix: `[üìù ]YYYY-MM-DD` (matches `üìù 2024-01-01`)
   - Multiple prefixes: `[üìù ]YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm, [‚ùé ]YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm`
3. **Tips**:
   - Square brackets `[]` match literal text
   - Use `T` as literal time separator
   - Common tokens: `YYYY` (year), `MM` (month), `DD` (day), `HH` (24h), `mm` (minutes)
   - See [Moment.js docs](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) for more tokens

#### Custom Cleanup Patterns

Add your own regex patterns to handle specific cleanup needs:

1. **Pattern Format**:
   - One pattern per line
   - Uses JavaScript regex syntax
   - Applied with global and unicode flags
2. **Common Examples**:
   - Remove date stamps: `\[\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\]` (matches `[2024-01-01]`)
   - Remove list markers: `^- ` (matches leading hyphens)
   - Remove parentheses: `\([^)]*\)` (matches `(any text)`)
3. **Tips**:
   - Test patterns on [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/) with JavaScript flavor
   - Patterns are cumulative with default patterns when enabled
   - Use `^` for start of line, `$` for end of line

## Design Philosophy

[Obsidian Todoist Context Bridge](https://exp.ptkm.net/obsidian-todoist-context-bridge) is built on [PTKM Core Principles](https://exp.ptkm.net/ptkm-core-principles):

1. **Context is King**
    - Tasks don't exist in isolation - they emerge from thoughts, plans, and projects
    - Original note context is crucial for effective task completion
    - Strong bidirectional links ensure context is always accessible
    - Reviewing context before completion leads to better outcomes
2. **Intentional Task Management**
    - Not every task needs to be in Todoist
    - Important tasks deserve special attention
    - Selective syncing keeps your task manager focused
    - Clear separation between planning and execution
3. **System Reliability**
    - Redundant storage provides safety and accessibility
    - One-way sync prevents conflicts and corruption
    - Clear workflows reduce confusion
    - Strong links maintain system integrity
