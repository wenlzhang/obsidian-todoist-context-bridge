## What Makes This Plugin Different

Unlike traditional Todoist sync plugins that try to sync everything, Context Bridge helps you:

- üîå **Integrate** with [Dataview](https://ptkm.net/obsidian-todoist-context-bridge-dataview-integration) and [Tasks](https://ptkm.net/obsidian-todoist-context-bridge-tasks-integration) plugins
- ‚ú® **Highlight** important tasks selectively in Todoist
- üîÑ **Sync** tasks bidirectionally between Obsidian and Todoist
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Maintain** temporal context
- üéØ **Focus** on what truly matters
- üìù **Support** various content formats (lists, tasks, callouts, quotes)

## Why You Need Todoist Context Bridge

[Todoist Context Bridge](https://ptkm.net/obsidian-todoist-context-bridge) was crafted with five [PTKM Core Principles](https://ptkm.net/ptkm-core-principles) that shape its functionality:

- **Task-Centered Workflow**: Prioritizing efficient task management and natural workflow integration
- **Context Preservation**: Ensuring no valuable information is lost in the task management process
- **Linking Everything**: Bridging the gap between Obsidian and Todoist
- **Focus on Priority**: Helping users concentrate on what truly matters
- **Reliable Redundancy**: Maintaining data integrity through smart synchronization

**Todoist Context Bridge** was born from a real-world challenge: the need to effectively highlight and track important tasks while preserving their complete context. As both an Obsidian enthusiast and Todoist power user, I discovered that while not every note-taking task warranted a place in my task manager, the crucial ones deserved focused attention and reliable tracking.

### The Challenge

Modern knowledge workers face a common dilemma: Obsidian excels at capturing tasks with rich context - embedding them within notes, projects, and thought processes. However, these important tasks can easily become buried in an ocean of notes and ideas. Todoist shines at task tracking and highlighting, but traditionally lacks the deep context that birthed these tasks.

### The Bridge

**Todoist Context Bridge** elegantly solves this challenge through four key mechanisms:

1. **Selective Sync**: Thoughtfully choose which tasks deserve promotion to your Todoist workflow
2. **Contextual Links**: Maintain robust bidirectional connections to your original Obsidian notes
3. **Reliable Redundancy**: Ensure task security through strategic presence in both systems
4. **Focused Management**: Keep your task system lean and relevant by promoting only what matters

## Bidirectional Task Completion Sync

This plugin supports automatic bidirectional synchronization of task completion status between Obsidian and Todoist. When enabled, the plugin will:

### Sync behavior

**Todoist ‚Üí Obsidian:**
- When you mark a task as completed in Todoist, it will be automatically marked as completed in Obsidian
- A completion timestamp will be appended to the task line (if enabled)
- The timestamp can use either the actual Todoist completion time or the sync time

**Obsidian ‚Üí Todoist:**
- When you mark a task as completed in Obsidian, it will be automatically marked as completed in Todoist
- No timestamp is added to the Obsidian task (to avoid conflicts with other plugins)
- We recommend using the [Task Marker](https://github.com/wenlzhang/obsidian-task-marker) plugin for Obsidian-side timestamping

### Configuration

1. **Enable bidirectional sync**: Toggle the "Enable bidirectional sync" setting
2. **Set sync interval**: Choose how often to check for changes (1-60 minutes)
3. **Choose sync scope**: Sync tasks in current file only or all files
4. **Enable completion timestamps**: Toggle timestamp appending when syncing from Todoist
5. **Choose timestamp source**: Use Todoist's actual completion time or the sync time
6. **Customize timestamp format**: Configure the timestamp format using moment.js syntax

### Performance optimization

**Time window filtering** (recommended for users with many historical tasks):
- **Enable time window filtering**: Only sync tasks modified/completed within a specified time window
- **Time window (days)**: Set the number of days to look back (0-90 days)
  - `0 days`: Sync all tasks (may be slow with many historical tasks)
  - `7 days`: Sync only recent tasks (recommended for daily use)
  - `30 days`: Balanced approach for monthly reviews
  - `90 days`: Comprehensive sync for quarterly reviews

**Smart filtering logic:**
- **Files with linked tasks**: Always processed (regardless of file age)
- **Tasks with future due dates**: Always included (regardless of task age)
- **Old files without tasks**: Skipped for performance
- **Completed tasks without due dates**: Filtered by time window

**Performance benefits:**
- **7-day window**: ~96% fewer tasks processed, ~28x faster sync
- **30-day window**: ~85% fewer tasks processed, ~7x faster sync
- **Reduced API calls**: Significantly fewer Todoist API requests
- **Intelligent file scanning**: Skip irrelevant files while preserving important tasks
- **Edge case handling**: Future-dated tasks in old files are never missed

### Requirements

- Tasks must be linked between Obsidian and Todoist using the existing sync functionality
- Both platforms must have the same task content for reliable matching
- The plugin will only sync completion status for tasks that exist in both platforms

### Recommended Setup

For comprehensive timestamp tracking in Obsidian, we recommend using the **[Task Marker](https://github.com/wenlzhang/obsidian-task-marker)** plugin alongside Todoist Context Bridge. Task Marker will automatically timestamp all task status changes in Obsidian, including completions, providing you with complete temporal tracking.


To enable bidirectional sync:
1. Go to plugin settings
2. Enable "Bidirectional task completion sync"
3. Optionally enable "Completion timestamp" for Todoist‚ÜíObsidian sync
4. Configure your preferred timestamp format using moment.js format strings
