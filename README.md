## Why You Need Todoist Context Bridge

[Todoist Context Bridge](https://ptkm.net/obsidian-todoist-context-bridge) was crafted with five [PTKM Core Principles](https://ptkm.net/ptkm-core-principles) that shape its functionality:

- **Task-Centered Workflow**: Prioritizing efficient task management and natural workflow integration
- **Context Preservation**: Ensuring no valuable information is lost in the task management process
- **Linking Everything**: Bridging the gap between Obsidian and Todoist
- **Focus on Priority**: Helping users concentrate on what truly matters
- **Reliable Redundancy**: Maintaining data integrity through smart synchronization

**Todoist Context Bridge** was born from a real-world challenge: the need to effectively highlight and track important tasks while preserving their complete context. As both an Obsidian enthusiast and Todoist power user, I discovered that while not every note-taking task warranted a place in my task manager, the crucial ones deserved focused attention and reliable tracking.

### The Challenge

Modern knowledge workers face a common dilemma: Obsidian excels at capturing tasks with rich context - embedding them within notes, projects, and thought processes. However, these important tasks can easily become buried in an ocean of notes and ideas. Todoist shines at task tracking and highlighting, but traditionally lacks the deep context that birthed these tasks.

### The Bridge

**Todoist Context Bridge** elegantly solves this challenge through four key mechanisms:

1. **Selective Sync**: Thoughtfully choose which tasks deserve promotion to your Todoist workflow
2. **Contextual Links**: Maintain robust bidirectional connections to your original Obsidian notes
3. **Reliable Redundancy**: Ensure task security through strategic presence in both systems
4. **Focused Management**: Keep your task system lean and relevant by promoting only what matters

## Bidirectional Task Completion Sync

üîÑ **Automatic bidirectional sync** keeps your task completion status synchronized between Obsidian and Todoist:

### How It Works

- **Obsidian ‚Üí Todoist**: When you mark a task as completed in Obsidian, the plugin automatically syncs the completion status to the corresponding task in Todoist
- **Todoist ‚Üí Obsidian**: When you mark a task as completed in Todoist, the plugin automatically marks the corresponding task as completed in Obsidian and optionally adds a completion timestamp

### Timestamp Behavior

**Important**: The plugin handles timestamps differently depending on the sync direction:

- **When completing tasks in Obsidian**: The plugin only syncs the completion status to Todoist. It does NOT add a timestamp to your Obsidian task, as this is expected to be handled by you or other plugins
- **When completing tasks in Todoist**: The plugin syncs the completion status to Obsidian AND adds a completion timestamp (if enabled in settings), since Todoist doesn't show completion timestamps visibly

### Recommended Setup

For comprehensive timestamp tracking in Obsidian, we recommend using the **[Task Marker](https://github.com/wenlzhang/obsidian-task-marker)** plugin alongside Todoist Context Bridge. Task Marker will automatically timestamp all task status changes in Obsidian, including completions, providing you with complete temporal tracking.

### Configuration

To enable bidirectional sync:
1. Go to plugin settings
2. Enable "Bidirectional task completion sync"
3. Optionally enable "Completion timestamp" for Todoist‚ÜíObsidian sync
4. Configure your preferred timestamp format using moment.js format strings
