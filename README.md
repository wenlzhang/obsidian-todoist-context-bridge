# Obsidian Simple Todoist Sync

A lightweight, efficient plugin for Obsidian that enables seamless one-way task synchronization from Obsidian to Todoist. This plugin focuses on simplicity and reliability while maintaining a strong connection between your Obsidian notes and tasks and Todoist reminders.

## The Story Behind This Plugin

This plugin emerged from a specific need: highlighting and tracking important tasks while maintaining their rich context. As an Obsidian user who relies on Todoist for task management, I found that not every task in my notes needed to be in Todoist - only the significant ones that required focused attention and tracking.

### The Problem

While Obsidian excels at capturing tasks within their full context (in notes, projects, or thinking processes), these tasks can get lost among countless other notes and ideas. Todoist, on the other hand, excels at highlighting and tracking important tasks, but lacks the rich context in which these tasks were created.

### The Solution

This plugin bridges this gap by:

1. Allowing you to selectively sync important tasks to Todoist
2. Maintaining strong links back to the original Obsidian context
3. Creating a reliable redundancy system - tasks exist both in your notes and your task manager
4. Keeping your task management system focused on what truly matters

This approach means:

- Your notes remain your primary source of truth
- Important tasks get the spotlight they deserve in Todoist
- You always have access to the full context when needed
- Your task management system stays clean and focused

## Design Philosophy

The decision to implement one-way synchronization (Obsidian â†’ Todoist) was deliberate and based on several key insights:

1. **Preserving Context**
   - Tasks in Obsidian often emerge from your notes and thinking process
   - The original note contains valuable context that shouldn't be lost
   - When completing tasks in Todoist, reviewing the original context in Obsidian is often beneficial
2. **Preventing Data Corruption**
   - Bidirectional sync can lead to complex conflict scenarios
   - Notes in Obsidian could be accidentally modified by automated sync
   - One-way sync ensures your notes remain exactly as you wrote them
3. **Intentional Task Completion**
   - When marking a task complete in Todoist, you should revisit the original note
   - This promotes better review and understanding of the completed work
   - Helps maintain the connection between tasks and their broader context
4. **Simplicity and Reliability**
   - One-way sync is easier to implement correctly
   - Fewer edge cases and potential failure points
   - More predictable behavior for users

This approach encourages a natural workflow where:

- Obsidian is your thinking and planning environment
- Todoist is your execution and tracking environment
- Each tool is used for what it does best

## Key Features

### Requirements

- Obsidian v0.15.0 or higher
- [Advanced URI](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-advanced-uri) plugin
- Todoist account and API token

## Setup

1. Get your Todoist API token:

   - Adjust other settings as needed

## Usage

### Basic Task Syncing

1. Create a task in Obsidian:
   ```markdown
   - [ ] Review meeting notes
   ```
2. Place your cursor on the task line
3. Use either:
   - Command palette: "Sync selected task to Todoist"
   - Hotkey: (customizable in Settings â†’ Hotkeys)
4. The task will be synced, and a link will be added:
   ```markdown
   - [ ] Review meeting notes
       - ðŸ”— [View in Todoist](https://todoist.com/app/task/12345678)
   ```

### Advanced Features

#### Project Selection

- Set a default project in settings
- Tasks sync to Inbox if no project is specified
