# Obsidian Todoist Context Bridge

A powerful Obsidian plugin that bridges your note-taking and task management workflows by maintaining strong contextual connections between Obsidian and Todoist. Unlike traditional sync plugins, Todoist Context Bridge helps you highlight important tasks while preserving their rich context, ensuring you never lose sight of the bigger picture.

## The Story Behind This Plugin

This plugin emerged from a specific need: highlighting and tracking important tasks while maintaining their rich context. As an Obsidian user who relies on Todoist for task management, I found that not every task in my notes needed to be in Todoist - only the significant ones that required focused attention and tracking.

### The Problem

While Obsidian excels at capturing tasks within their full context (in notes, projects, or thinking processes), these tasks can get lost among countless other notes and ideas. Todoist, on the other hand, excels at highlighting and tracking important tasks, but lacks the rich context in which these tasks were created.

### The Solution

This plugin bridges this gap by:
1. Allowing you to selectively sync important tasks to Todoist
2. Maintaining strong links back to the original Obsidian context
3. Creating a reliable redundancy system - tasks exist both in your notes and your task manager
4. Keeping your task management system focused on what truly matters

## Design Philosophy

Context Bridge is built on three core principles:

1. **Context is King**
   - Tasks don't exist in isolation - they emerge from thoughts, plans, and projects
   - Original note context is crucial for effective task completion
   - Strong bidirectional links ensure context is always accessible
   - Reviewing context before completion leads to better outcomes

2. **Intentional Task Management**
   - Not every task needs to be in Todoist
   - Important tasks deserve special attention
   - Selective syncing keeps your task manager focused
   - Clear separation between planning and execution

3. **System Reliability**
   - Redundant storage provides safety and accessibility
   - One-way sync prevents conflicts and corruption
   - Clear workflows reduce confusion
   - Strong links maintain system integrity
