## Why Choose This Plugin?

In the landscape of Todoist integration plugins, Todoist Context Bridge stands out by solving a unique challenge: maintaining the crucial connection between tasks and their context.

### Comparison with Other Plugins

| Feature | Todoist Context Bridge | Traditional Sync Plugins | Other Todoist Plugins |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Task Sync | One-way, intentional | Often bidirectional | Varies |
| Context Preservation | âœ“ Strong links to notes | âœ— Limited or none | âœ— Usually none |
| Task Selection | Selective, focused | Usually all tasks | Varies |
| System Reliability | Redundant storage | Single system | Single system |

   - Encourages revisiting context before completion
   - Preserves the full story behind each task

2. **Intentional Task Highlighting**
   - Selectively promote important tasks to Todoist
   - Keep task management focused and relevant
   - Prevent task overload in Todoist

3. **Robust System Design**
   - Redundant task storage for reliability
   - One-way sync prevents conflicts
   - Clear separation of concerns

4. **Thoughtful Workflow Integration**
   - Natural flow between planning and execution
   - Easy context navigation when needed
   - Structured task completion process

## The Story Behind This Plugin

This plugin emerged from a specific need: highlighting and tracking important tasks while maintaining their rich context. As an Obsidian user who relies on Todoist for task management, I found that not every task in my notes needed to be in Todoist - only the significant ones that required focused attention and tracking.

### The Problem

While Obsidian excels at capturing tasks within their full context (in notes, projects, or thinking processes), these tasks can get lost among countless other notes and ideas. Todoist, on the other hand, excels at highlighting and tracking important tasks, but lacks the rich context in which these tasks were created.

### The Solution

This plugin bridges this gap by:

1. Allowing you to selectively sync important tasks to Todoist
2. Maintaining strong links back to the original Obsidian context
3. Creating a reliable redundancy system - tasks exist both in your notes and your task manager
4. Keeping your task management system focused on what truly matters

This approach means:

- Your notes remain your primary source of truth
- Important tasks get the spotlight they deserve in Todoist
- You always have access to the full context when needed
- Your task management system stays clean and focused

## Design Philosophy

The design of Todoist Context Bridge is built around three core principles:

1. **Context is King**
   - Tasks don't exist in isolation - they emerge from thoughts, plans, and projects
   - Original note context is crucial for effective task completion
   - Strong bidirectional links ensure context is always accessible
   - Reviewing context before completion leads to better outcomes

2. **Intentional Task Management**
   - Not every task needs to be in Todoist
   - Important tasks deserve special attention
   - Selective syncing keeps your task manager focused
   - Clear separation between planning and execution

3. **System Reliability**
   - Redundant storage provides safety and accessibility
   - One-way sync prevents conflicts and corruption
   - Clear workflows reduce confusion
   - Strong links maintain system integrity

This approach encourages a natural workflow where:

- Obsidian serves as your thinking and planning environment
- Todoist highlights your important actionable items
- Context bridges ensure you never lose sight of the bigger picture
- Each tool is used for its strengths
