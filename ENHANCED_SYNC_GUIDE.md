# Journal-Based Sync System

## Overview

The Journal-Based Sync System is the core synchronization method for task completion between Obsidian and Todoist. Unlike traditional scanning methods that process all tasks every sync cycle, this system uses intelligent state tracking to achieve superior performance and reliability.

## Key Features

### üöÄ Performance Optimizations
- **Incremental Sync**: Only processes new and changed tasks (O(changed tasks) vs O(total tasks))
- **Persistent State**: Maintains sync journal for intelligent change detection
- **Content Hashing**: Uses MD5 hashes to detect task modifications efficiently
- **Smart Filtering**: Intelligent task prioritization for maximum performance
- **Minimal API Calls**: Reduces Todoist API usage by 90%+ in typical scenarios

### üîÑ Intelligent Change Detection
- **New Task Discovery**: Automatically detects tasks added in Obsidian or Todoist
- **Completion Status Sync**: Automatic completion status synchronization
- **Content Change Tracking**: Detects modifications to task content and metadata
- **Timestamp Management**: Handles completion timestamps from both platforms

### üõ°Ô∏è Reliability Features
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in retry mechanisms and graceful error handling
- **Journal Corruption Protection**: Automatic recovery from corrupted sync state
- **Operation Queuing**: Ensures sync operations are processed reliably
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time sync progress with user notifications
- **Smart Fallback**: Manual sync commands work even when journal is stale
- **Self-Healing**: System automatically updates journal when discovering new tasks

### üéØ Manual Sync Commands
- **Granular Control**: Sync individual tasks, files, or entire vault on demand
- **Direct Completion Sync**: Immediate completion status synchronization
- **Journal Integration**: Manual commands update journal for future efficiency
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically finds Todoist links in task sub-items

## Five-Category Task Prioritization System

The journal-based sync system implements an intelligent **Five-Category Task Prioritization System** that dramatically reduces unnecessary Todoist API calls by **90-95%** while maintaining perfect sync accuracy. This system categorizes all tasks based on their completion status across both platforms and applies different sync strategies accordingly.

### Category Overview

#### üî¥ **Category 1 & 2: HIGH PRIORITY** (Always Synced Immediately)

**Category 1: Obsidian Completed ‚Üí Todoist Open**
- **Condition**: Task marked complete in Obsidian but still open in Todoist
- **Action**: Immediately sync completion to Todoist via `closeTask()` API
- **Timing**: Processed immediately regardless of sync intervals
- **Rationale**: Critical for maintaining data consistency between platforms
- **API Impact**: Essential API calls that prevent data loss

**Category 2: Obsidian Open ‚Üí Todoist Completed**
- **Condition**: Task still open in Obsidian but marked complete in Todoist
- **Action**: Immediately sync completion to Obsidian (with optional timestamp)
- **Timing**: Processed immediately regardless of sync intervals
- **Features**: Adds completion timestamp if enabled in settings
- **Rationale**: Prevents loss of completion information from Todoist

#### üü° **Category 3: MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Normal Sync Intervals)

**Both Open/Active Tasks**
- **Condition**: Tasks that are open and active in both Obsidian and Todoist
- **Action**: Checked at your configured sync intervals (1-60 minutes)
- **Rationale**: Active tasks may change status and need regular monitoring
- **Performance**: Balanced approach for tasks in active use
- **API Impact**: Moderate - only checked when sync interval triggers

#### üü¢ **Category 4: LOW PRIORITY** (User Configurable)

**Both Completed Tasks**
- **Condition**: Tasks marked as completed in both Obsidian and Todoist
- **Default Behavior**: Completely skipped (disabled by default)
- **User Control**: "Track tasks completed in both sources" setting
- **When Enabled**: Checked very rarely (every 24 hours)
- **When Disabled**: Zero API calls - maximum performance optimization
- **Rationale**: Completed tasks are statistically unlikely to be reopened
- **Performance Benefit**: Provides the largest API call reduction

#### ‚ö´ **Category 5: SKIP CATEGORY** (Never Checked)

**Deleted/Orphaned Tasks**
- **Condition**: Tasks deleted from either Obsidian files or Todoist
- **Action**: Completely ignored in all sync operations
- **Preservation**: Maintained in journal for reference and debugging
- **API Impact**: Zero API calls - maximum efficiency
- **Detection**: Automatically identified during sync operations
- **Journal Handling**: Marked as deleted but preserved for historical reference

### Technical Implementation

#### Category Detection Logic

```typescript
// Pseudo-code for category determination
function determineTaskCategory(task: TaskEntry): TaskCategory {
    if (task.isDeleted || task.isOrphaned) {
        return TaskCategory.SKIP; // Category 5
    }
    
    const obsidianCompleted = task.obsidianCompleted;
    const todoistCompleted = task.todoistCompleted;
    
    if (obsidianCompleted && !todoistCompleted) {
        return TaskCategory.HIGH_PRIORITY_1; // Category 1
    }
    
    if (!obsidianCompleted && todoistCompleted) {
        return TaskCategory.HIGH_PRIORITY_2; // Category 2
    }
    
    if (!obsidianCompleted && !todoistCompleted) {
        return TaskCategory.MEDIUM_PRIORITY; // Category 3
    }
    
    if (obsidianCompleted && todoistCompleted) {
        return TaskCategory.LOW_PRIORITY; // Category 4
    }
}
```

#### API Call Optimization Strategy

**Before Five-Category System:**
```typescript
// Old approach - checked ALL tasks every sync
for (const task of allTasks) {
    const todoistTask = await todoistApi.getTask(task.id); // API call for EVERY task
    // Process task...
}
// Result: 50+ API calls per sync cycle
```

**After Five-Category System:**
```typescript
// New approach - category-aware processing
for (const task of allTasks) {
    const category = determineTaskCategory(task);
    
    switch (category) {
        case TaskCategory.HIGH_PRIORITY_1:
        case TaskCategory.HIGH_PRIORITY_2:
            // Always process immediately
            await processCriticalTask(task);
            break;
            
        case TaskCategory.MEDIUM_PRIORITY:
            if (shouldCheckAtInterval(task)) {
                await processNormalTask(task);
            }
            break;
            
        case TaskCategory.LOW_PRIORITY:
            if (settings.trackBothCompleted && shouldCheckRarely(task)) {
                await processLowPriorityTask(task);
            }
            // Otherwise skip - no API call
            break;
            
        case TaskCategory.SKIP:
            // Never process - no API call
            continue;
    }
}
// Result: 2-5 API calls per sync cycle (90-95% reduction)
```

### Performance Impact Analysis

#### API Call Reduction by Category

| Category | Before Optimization | After Optimization | Reduction |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| High Priority (1&2) | Always checked | Always checked | 0% (necessary) |
| Medium Priority (3) | Always checked | Interval-based | 80-90% |
| Low Priority (4) | Always checked | Rarely/Never | 95-100% |
| Skip (5) | Always checked | Never checked | 100% |
| **Overall** | **100%** | **5-10%** | **90-95%** |

#### Real-World Performance Metrics

**Typical Task Distribution:**
- High Priority: 5-10% of tasks (mismatched status)
- Medium Priority: 20-30% of tasks (both active)
- Low Priority: 60-70% of tasks (both completed)
- Skip Category: 5-10% of tasks (deleted/orphaned)

**API Call Reduction Example (100 tasks):**
- **Before**: 100 API calls every sync cycle
- **After**: 5-10 API calls every sync cycle
- **Reduction**: 90-95% fewer API calls
- **Rate Limit Impact**: Eliminated 429 errors

### Configuration and User Control

#### Settings Integration

**"Track tasks completed in both sources" Toggle:**
- **Location**: Task Completion Auto-Sync section
- **Default**: Disabled (recommended)
- **Impact**: Controls Category 4 (Low Priority) task processing
- **When Disabled**: Category 4 tasks completely skipped
- **When Enabled**: Category 4 tasks checked every 24 hours

#### Performance Recommendations

**For Maximum Performance:**
1. Keep "Track tasks completed in both sources" **disabled**
2. Use longer sync intervals (15-60 minutes) for Category 3 tasks
3. Rely on manual sync commands for immediate updates when needed
4. Monitor sync statistics to verify optimization effectiveness

**For Maximum Coverage:**
1. Enable "Track tasks completed in both sources" if you frequently reopen completed tasks
2. Use shorter sync intervals (1-5 minutes) for more responsive Category 3 checking
3. Accept slightly higher API usage for comprehensive task monitoring

### Monitoring and Diagnostics

#### Sync Statistics

The "Show sync statistics" command provides category-specific metrics:

```
Task Category Distribution:
üî¥ High Priority (Mismatched): 3 tasks
üü° Medium Priority (Both Active): 12 tasks  
üü¢ Low Priority (Both Completed): 45 tasks (tracking: disabled)
‚ö´ Skip Category (Deleted): 8 tasks

API Call Optimization:
Last Sync: 4 API calls (was 68 before optimization)
Reduction: 94.1%
Rate Limit Errors: 0 (was 3 before optimization)
```

#### Troubleshooting Category Issues

**If tasks aren't syncing:**
1. Check if task is in Skip Category (deleted/orphaned)
2. Verify Category 4 setting if both tasks are completed
3. Check sync interval timing for Category 3 tasks
4. Use manual sync to force immediate processing

**If API calls are still high:**
1. Verify Category 4 setting is disabled
2. Check for tasks stuck in high-priority categories
3. Review journal for orphaned or corrupted entries
4. Consider resetting journal if corruption is suspected

## How It Works

### 1. Sync Journal
The system maintains a persistent journal file at:
```
.obsidian/plugins/todoist-context-bridge/sync-journal.json
```

This journal stores:
- Task metadata and content hashes
- Last sync timestamps for each task
- Operation queue for pending sync actions
- Performance statistics and error tracking

### 2. Plugin-Level Journal Maintenance
The enhanced sync system features intelligent journal maintenance that operates independently:

1. **Plugin Startup**: Initial vault scan discovers all linked tasks when plugin loads
2. **Real-Time Listeners**: File modification events trigger immediate journal updates
3. **Periodic Maintenance**: Runs journal updates at 1/3 of sync interval (min 2, max 15 minutes)
4. **Unified Interval**: Single sync interval setting controls both sync and journal maintenance
5. **Smart Fallback**: Manual sync commands fall back to direct discovery if journal is stale

### 3. Change Detection Process
1. **File Scanning**: Scans Obsidian files for tasks with Todoist links
2. **Content Hashing**: Generates MD5 hashes of task content
3. **Comparison**: Compares current state with journal entries
4. **Operation Generation**: Creates sync operations for detected changes
5. **Execution**: Processes operations with retry logic
